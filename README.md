Here is a repository to present projects mentioned on my LinkedIn.

## Global Carbon Emissions Visualization
Together with a team of 4, we used d3.js to transform global carbon emissions data into three interactive visualizations. Seamlessly integrated, these visualizations offer diverse perspectives, empowering users to explore trends, regional disparities, and sectoral breakdowns with ease.

## LEARN (Learn 'Em All Right Now)
LEARN is a dynamic virtual flashcard program tailored for students seeking an ad-free and accessible studying experience. Developed using Java and powered by Maven, LEARN offers an intuitive interface for creating personalized flashcards and leveraging them across various study activities, including quizzes. This program is not fully completed but there will be no more work put towards it anytime soon, if at all. It does the basics but could be further developed.
